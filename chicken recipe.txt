Chicken stuffed with spinach and pancetta

INGREDIENTS
4 large free-range chicken breasts, with skin
200g baby spinach
2 tbsp olive oil
100g pack cubed pancetta
1 red onion, finely chopped
200g mascarpone
40g grated Parmesan

METHOD
01.Preheat the oven to 200°C/fan180°C/gas 6. Make an incision in the side of the chicken breasts to form a pocket, then set aside.
02.Place the spinach in a colander in the sink and pour a kettle of just-boiled water over to wilt it. Refresh under cold water, squeeze out as much liquid as possible, then chop.
03.Heat half the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Fry the pancetta for 3 minutes until it starts to turn golden. Add the onion and fry for another 5 minutes until the pancetta is crisp and the onion is softened.
04.Add the spinach, mascarpone and Parmesan to the pan. Mix together, season and set aside to cool a little.
05.Spoon the mixture into the pockets of the chicken breasts and secure each with 1-2 cocktail sticks. Put in a shallow roasting tin, drizzle with the remaining oil, and season. Roast for 20-25 minutes until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through.
